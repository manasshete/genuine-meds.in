                    <h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Information</h4>
                    <p>Consult your doctor before using Metformin if you have kidney disease, liver disease, heart problems, or are pregnant/breastfeeding.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="drug-section">
                    <h3>What is Metformin?</h3>
                    <p>Metformin is a commonly prescribed medication  used to manage type 2 diabetes. It helps 
your body to use sugar in more efficient way.  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="drug-section">
    <h3>How it Works?</h3>
    <p>Think of sugar (glucose) as energy source for your body's cells. In type 2 diabetes, insulin secreted by beta cells of pancreas won't properly. This leads to too much sugar staying in your blood. Metformin manages this problem by following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Reduces sugar production by the liver: your liver naturally produces sugar from non-glucose molecules like fats and proteins (this process is called gluconeogenesis). Metformin helps to slow down this process, so less sugar is released into your blood.</li>
        <li>2. Improves insulin sensitivity: It helps your body's cells respond better to the insulin available in body. This allows more sugar to enter your cells for energy.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

     <div class="drug-section">
     <h3>Uses</h3>
    <p>Metformin is mainly used for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Type 2 Diabetes: As a first-line treatment, commonly prescribed when diet and exercise alone aren't enough to control blood sugar levels. It can be used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs.</li>
        <li>Prediabetes: Sometimes, doctors prescribe it to prevent type 2 diabetes in people who are at high risk.</li>
        <li>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): Metformin can be used to help manage PCOS symptoms, such as reduced insulin sensitivity, obesity, and irregular periods, even if you don't have diabetes.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

                <div class="drug-section">
    <h3>Dosage</h3>
    <p><strong>Adults:</strong> Initial dose is 500 mg orally twice a day or 850 mg orally once a day. Dose can be increased with regular monitoring of blood glucose levels. Maximum daily dose is 2000 mg.</p>
</div>

                <div class="drug-section">
    <h3>Side Effects</h3>
    <p>Many people experience some mild side effects, especially in initial few weeks of starting metformin. These usually improve over time. Common Side Effects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Bloating, gas</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Metallic taste in your mouth</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Less Common but More Serious Side Effects</strong> (seek medical attention if you experience these):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lactic Acidosis: This is a very rare but serious side effect where too much lactic acid accumulates in your blood. It's more likely if you have kidney problems or liver problems, drink a lot of alcohol. Symptoms can include tiredness, weakness, muscle ache, difficulty in breathing, diarrhea, fever, and an increase in heart rate.</li>
        <li>Vitamin B12 Deficiency: Long-term use of metformin, especially in higher doses, can sometimes lead to lower levels of vitamin B12. Your doctor may recommend checking your B12 levels or taking a supplement.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

                <div class="drug-section">
    <h3>Safety Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> It is unsafe to consume alcohol with metformin tablet</li>
        <li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Metformin is safe to use in pregnancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Breastfeeding:</strong> Metformin is safe to use in breastfeeding.</li>
        <li><strong>Kidney:</strong> Metformin should be used with special caution in kidney disease. It can increase the risk of lactic acidosis/Dose reduction is needed. Please consult your doctor. It can increase the risk of lactic acidosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Liver:</strong> Metformin is safe to use in liver disease.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

                <div class="drug-section">
    <h3>Drug Interactions</h3>
    <p>Metformin can interact with other medications, which can either make metformin less effective, increase its side effects, or affect your blood sugar levels.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Other Diabetes Medications (e.g., insulin, sulfonylureas): Combining metformin with these can increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).</li>
        <li>Alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol with metformin can significantly increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Limit your alcohol intake.</li>
        <li>Diuretics ("water pills," e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide): These can sometimes make metformin less effective.</li>
        <li>Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone): These can increase blood sugar levels, making metformin less effective.</li>
        <li>Some Antipsychotic Medications (e.g., clozapine): Can increase blood sugar levels.</li>
        <li>Beta blockers (e.g., propranolol): Can affect blood sugar levels and mask symptoms of low blood sugar.</li>
    </ul>
